# Our Values

At EcoMana, we proudly embrace Māori principles in all our projects, guided by values that connect us with the land, our communities, and the spirit. Our goal is to increase the mana (spiritual power) of the places we work, honoring both the environment and the people we serve.

## Whakawhanaungatanga – Family, Relationship-Building

Whakawhanaungatanga is at the heart of everything we do. This value drives us to build strong relationships, foster networks, and make meaningful connections. It reflects our commitment to working collaboratively, ensuring that every interaction strengthens the bonds within the community.

## Wairuatanga – Spiritual, Health, and Wellbeing

Wairuatanga emphasizes the importance of following the correct spiritual protocols, such as Karakia, while maintaining a sense of calm and wellbeing in all that we do. By incorporating this principle, we ensure that our work supports health, balance, and spiritual grounding for both the land and the people involved.

## Our Objective

Through these values, EcoMana strives to uplift the mana of the places where we work. By honoring the Māori principles of Whakawhanaungatanga and Wairuatanga, we aim to deliver not only quality workmanship but also a deep, respectful connection to community, culture, and the environment.
